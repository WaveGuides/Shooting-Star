# Shooting Star

> A Eurorack Unbusboard

These boards implement true star grounding. Every header has it's own trace to PSU.

## PSU Considerations

Shooting Star boards are intended to be used with a linear power supply. Said that, you can use any PSU you like, as long as it delivers Â±12V. Some sugestions might need a DC-DC converter for the 5V rail.

> :bangbang: Please make sure you have read requirements of the chosen PSU. Some require cooling.
